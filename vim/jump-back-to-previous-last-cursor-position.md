# Jump Back To Previous or Last Cursor Position

The quickest way is to hit either:

```
''
```

(two apostrophes) or:

```
``
```

`CTRL-O` : Retrace your movements in file in backwards.

`CTRL-I` : Retrace your movements in file in forwards.

From the vim help files:

Jumps are remembered in a jump list. With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again. Thus you can move up and down the list. There is a separate jump list for each window. The maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.
