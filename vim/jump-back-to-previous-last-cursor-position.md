# Jump Back To Previous or Last Cursor Position

[a] '. : Jump to last modification line.

[b] `. : Jump to exact spot in last modification line

[c] CTRL-O : Retrace your movements in file in backwards.

[d] CTRL-I : Retrace your movements in file in forwards.
From the vim help files:

Jumps are remembered in a jump list. With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again. Thus you can move up and down the list. There is a separate jump list for each window. The maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.
